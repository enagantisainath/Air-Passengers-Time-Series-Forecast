# Air-Passengers-Time-Series-Forecast


Forecast the number of airline passengers (in 1000s). Data is available on Analytics Vidya Website.<br>
Air Passengers Project is literally the <b>Hello world</b> of Time Series projects.


I have used three models in this notebook.

- Holt Winters Exponential Smoothing (HWES)
- ARIMA 
- S-ARIMA

## Methods/ Techniques :
- Augmented Dicky Fuller Test
- Auto Correlation Function (ACF) and Partial Auto Correlation Function (PACF)



I will add more time series models in this notebook in future.
